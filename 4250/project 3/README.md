**CS 4250 Programming Languages Fall 2019**

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Project #3 [55 points].**

Due date is Wednesday, October 23 (11:59 pm).

Note that submission date has been changed!

This is a programming project. Write your programs using logical language Prolog. Use SWISH (SWI Prolog for Sharing). Run each of your programs by typing a query and clicking on &#39;Run&#39; button.

1. [25 points] Consider a hypothetical family tree shown below:

Create a simple database containing facts and inference rules. Include facts about family members, such as _male_, _female_, _parent_. Then add rules such as _sister_, _brother_, _sibling_, _father_, _mother_, _grandparent_. Run queries that will answer the following questions about family members: (a) Is Pete Mark&#39;s parent? (b) Is Anne Jenny&#39;s parent? (c) Who is Todd&#39;s father? (d) Who is Tom&#39;s sibling? (e) Who is Lilly&#39;s brother? (f) Who is Henry&#39;s grandparent? (g) Who is Alice&#39;s sister? (h) Is Frank Kate&#39;s brother? (i) Who is Matt&#39;s mother? (j) Is Mark Anne&#39;s brother?

Submission file should include your database and screenshots of the results of all queries.

1. [17 points] Write a Prolog program that finds the maximum of a list of numbers. Submission file should include a screenshot with tracing a program execution when a list only has 2 members and execution without tracing when a list has 8 elements.

1. [13 points] Write a Prolog program that returns a list containing a union of the elements of two given sets.
